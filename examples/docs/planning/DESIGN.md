## Project Overview
A Chrome extension that allows users to select an existing tweet, trigger the extension via context menu, and receive 10 similar tweet ideas based on pre-configured content style and audience preferences.

## Problem Statement
Content creators struggle with consistently generating fresh tweet ideas that maintain their voice and resonate with their audience. Manual brainstorming is time-consuming and often results in creative blocks.

## Solution
Our extension will:
1. Allow selection of any tweet text on Twitter
2. Process the selected content through NLP/AI to understand context, tone, and structure
3. Generate 10 unique but similar ideas tailored to the user's predefined content style and audience
4. Present these ideas in a clean, usable format for immediate use or saving

## Scope

### MVP Features (Must-Have)
- Context menu integration for tweet selection
- Simple configuration page for profile setup (content style, audience)
- Integration with AI text generation API
- Generation of 10 similar tweet ideas
- Basic UI for displaying results
- Copy functionality for generated ideas

### Future Enhancements (Nice-to-Have)
- Direct posting to Twitter
- Saved ideas library
- Custom templates
- Analytics on idea performance
- Batch processing of multiple tweets
- Style variation controls

## Technical Approach

### Extension Structure
- **Background Script**: Handles context menu creation, API communication
- **Content Script**: Extracts selected tweet text, injects UI elements
- **Popup**: User configuration and settings
- **Options Page**: Detailed settings and preferences

### Technologies
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **API Integration**: OpenAI API or similar NLP service
- **Storage**: Chrome Extension Storage API for user preferences
- **UI Framework**: Lightweight framework like Alpine.js or vanilla JS
- **Authentication**: Simple API key storage for third-party services

### API Requirements
We'll need an NLP/AI service that can:
- Analyze tweet content and structure
- Generate similar content with variations
- Maintain consistent tone and style
- Handle user-specific context

Options include:
- OpenAI API (GPT models)
- Cohere
- Anthropic's Claude
- HuggingFace's inference API

### Data Flow
1. User selects tweet text and triggers extension
2. Extension captures text and metadata
3. Background script sends data to AI API with user preferences
4. API returns generated ideas
5. Extension displays ideas in popup UI
6. User can copy, save, or post ideas

## User Experience

### User Flow
1. Install extension
2. Configure profile (content style, audience, preferences)
3. Browse Twitter
4. Select interesting tweet
5. Right-click and select \"Generate Similar Ideas\"
6. View generated ideas in popup
7. Copy preferred ideas for use

### Interface Design Principles
- Clean, minimal interface
- Twitter-like styling for familiarity
- Clear categorization of generated ideas
- Easy copying and saving functionality
- Unobtrusive integration with Twitter

## Development Resources
- Chrome Extension Documentation
- Context Menus API
- Twitter's page structure
- NLP/AI API documentation

## Privacy & Security Considerations
- All user data stored locally when possible
- Secure handling of API keys
- Clear permissions requirements
- No unnecessary data collection
- Compliance with Twitter's terms of service

## Business Model Options
- Freemium model (basic features free, advanced features paid)
- API usage limits for free tier
- Subscription for unlimited generations
- One-time purchase option

## Success Criteria
- Extension successfully generates relevant, usable tweet ideas
- User feedback indicates time saved in content creation
- Low friction in the selection and generation process
- High rate of generated ideas actually being used
