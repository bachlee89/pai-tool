# PAI Tool Architecture

This document describes the architectural design of the PAI (Project AI Tooling) system, explaining its components, interactions, and design decisions.

## System Overview

PAI Tool is designed as a modular, shell-based utility following the principles of:

1. **Simplicity**: Minimal dependencies and straightforward operation
2. **Modularity**: Well-defined components with specific responsibilities
3. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new templates and commands
4. **Self-containment**: All necessary functionality in a single project

## Component Architecture

### Core Components

```
+----------------+     +----------------+     +----------------+
|                |     |                |     |                |
|  Command Line  |---->|  Command       |---->|  Template      |
|  Interface     |     |  Handlers      |     |  Management    |
|                |     |                |     |                |
+----------------+     +----------------+     +----------------+
                              |
                              |
                              v
                       +----------------+
                       |                |
                       |  Utility       |
                       |  Functions     |
                       |                |
                       +----------------+
```

#### Command Line Interface (pai.sh)

The main entry point that:
- Parses command-line arguments
- Dispatches to appropriate command handlers
- Provides the help system
- Manages execution flow

#### Command Handlers (pai_* functions)

Individual functions that implement each command:
- `pai_init`: Project initialization with templates
- `pai_prompts`: AI prompt template management
- `pai_version`: Version display and checking
- `pai_upgrade`: Self-update mechanism
- `pai_help`: Context-sensitive help system

#### Template Management

System for managing project templates:
- Template storage in examples directory
- Template application to user projects
- Configuration file management

#### Utility Functions (utils.sh)

Shared utility functions for:
- Error handling and logging
- File and directory operations
- Version checking
- Network operations

### Installation System

The installation component (install.sh) handles:
- Repository cloning/downloading
- PATH configuration
- Shell integration
- Initialization of configuration files

## Data Flow

1. User invokes PAI with a command and arguments
2. Main script parses arguments and dispatches to handler
3. Command handler performs requested operation
4. Results are displayed to the user

Example flow for `pai init cursor`:

```
+--------+    +-----------+    +--------------+    +------------+
|        |    |           |    |              |    |            |
| User   |--->| pai.sh    |--->| pai_init()   |--->| Template   |
| Input  |    | (parser)  |    | function     |    | Files      |
|        |    |           |    |              |    |            |
+--------+    +-----------+    +--------------+    +------------+
                                      |
                                      v
                               +--------------+
                               |              |
                               | User's       |
                               | Project Dir  |
                               |              |
                               +--------------+
```

## Design Decisions

### Shell Scripting as Implementation Language

Chose POSIX-compliant shell scripting for:
- Minimal dependencies (works on any Unix-like system)
- No compilation required
- Direct access to system commands
- Familiar to DevOps practitioners

### Function-Based Modularity

Organized code into functions with the `pai_` prefix to:
- Maintain clear namespacing
- Enable easy testing
- Facilitate code reuse
- Improve readability

### Template-Based Configuration

Used a template-based approach for:
- Easy customization by users
- Standardization of configurations
- Simplified onboarding for new projects

### Self-Update Mechanism

Implemented a self-update system to:
- Keep users on the latest version
- Automate maintenance
- Provide a clean upgrade path
- Include rollback capability

## Extensibility Points

PAI Tool can be extended in several ways:

1. **New Commands**: Add new functions and update command dispatch
2. **New Templates**: Create additional template types in examples directory
3. **Enhanced Utilities**: Expand utility functions for additional capabilities
4. **Integration Points**: Add hooks for integration with other tools

## Security Considerations

- **Permission Model**: Uses standard file system permissions
- **No Elevated Privileges**: Designed to run without sudo/root
- **Safe Defaults**: Conservative defaults for file operations
- **Backup Before Modification**: Creates backups before making changes

## Performance Considerations

- **Minimal Dependencies**: Relies on standard Unix tools
- **Efficient Command Execution**: Minimizes unnecessary operations
- **Lazy Loading**: Only loads required components

## Future Architectural Improvements

- **Plugin System**: Allow third-party plugins for custom commands
- **Configuration System**: Enhanced user configuration
- **Remote Templates**: Support for fetching templates from remote repositories
- **Event Hooks**: Pre/post command execution hooks
